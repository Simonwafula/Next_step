# Next Step - Complete Guide for Non-Technical Users

## What Is Next Step?

**Next Step is like Google for jobs in Kenya, combined with a career coach.**

Instead of searching job sites one by one (BrighterMonday, LinkedIn, Indeed, etc.), Next Step brings all jobs together in ONE place. Then it does something special: **it translates your skills and education into matching job opportunities.**

---

## The Problem It Solves

### Before Next Step:
```
You: "I studied economics. What jobs can I get?"
    ↓
You search BrighterMonday... browse 50 pages
You search LinkedIn... browse 30 more pages  
You search Indeed... browse 40 more pages
    ↓
You see the SAME jobs multiple times (duplicates)
You don't know which jobs match your skills
You have no idea what salary to expect
    ↓
Result: Frustration and wasted time
```

### With Next Step:
```
You: "I studied economics"
    ↓
Next Step:
  • Searches 102,000+ jobs instantly
  • Removes duplicates automatically
  • Shows you: "These 15 jobs match economics graduates"
  • Tells you: "Average salary is KES 120,000"
  • Shows: "Top skills employers want: Data Analysis, Research, Excel"
    ↓
Result: You find relevant jobs in minutes, not hours
```
