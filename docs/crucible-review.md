# The Crucible: Next Step Adversarial Review

**Date:** February 14, 2026

## Executive Summary

Next Step was subjected to an adversarial review using 4 specialized AI critics. The goal was to stress-test the core assumptions and identify critical vulnerabilities.

---

## The Panel

| Adversary | Role | Focus |
|-----------|------|-------|
| **Valerie "Val" Uation** | Financial Realist | Revenue, monetization, sustainability |
| **Marcus "Mark" Iterate** | Cynical User | 22-year-old Kenyan graduate |
| **General K.O.** | Competitor Analyst | Competitive threats, moats |
| **Reginald "Rex" Mondo** | Pragmatist | Feasibility, execution, operations |

---

## Critical Vulnerabilities Identified

### 1. No Validated Revenue Model (FATAL)
- Users (students/job seekers) have no purchasing power
- No identified paying customer segment
- Free product with no path to sustainability

### 2. 65% Skill Accuracy Destroys Trust (FATAL)
- 1 in 3 skills is wrong
- Users can't make career decisions on unreliable data
- Undermines entire "intelligence" value proposition

### 3. No Defensible Moat (SEVERE)
- Deduplication is table stakes, not differentiation
- Google for Jobs aggregates for free
- BrighterMonday could build this in a month

### 4. Zero Brand Awareness (SEVERE)
- In a trust-driven market, no one knows Next Step
- Users go where their network goes

### 5. Scraper Maintenance Debt (MODERATE)
- 15+ scrapers = 15+ points of failure
- Stale data kills user trust

---

## Key Recurring Themes

1. **"Free for Users" Trap**: Students don't pay. No alternative payer identified.

2. **Trust Requires Accuracy**: 65% accuracy destroys trust. Can't build a career guidance brand on unreliable data.

3. **Feature vs. Product**: Aggregation/search might be a feature of existing platforms, not a standalone business.

4. **Diffuse Target Market**: Serving students, career changers, educators, and policymakers = serving no one well.

---

## The Pivot Decision

### Before (Original Pitch):
> "We're a career intelligence platform for students, job seekers, career changers, and policymakers."

### After (Revised Pitch):
> "We're the labor market intelligence layer for Kenyan universities and institutions."

---

## Strategic Changes

| Before | After |
|--------|-------|
| **Customer**: Job seekers (no money) | **Customer**: University career centers (KSh 500K-2M budgets) |
| **Revenue**: Freemium (unproven) | **Revenue**: B2B subscriptions (KSh 200K-500K/year) |
| **Value**: Job matching | **Value**: Curriculum-to-market alignment |
| **Product**: Job board | **Product**: Skill demand reports + API |
| **Scope**: 15 scrapers | **Scope**: 3 high-quality sources |
| **Accuracy**: 65% acceptable | **Accuracy**: 90%+ quality gate |

---

## New Revenue Model

### Product: Skill Demand Report for [Degree Program]

**Single Report: KSh 5,000**
- Top 10 skills by frequency for degree
- Sample job titles and counts
- 5 recent job listings as evidence
- Salary range (if available)

**University Package: KSh 200K/year**
- 50 degree programs covered
- Quarterly updates
- Placement analytics
- API access

**Full LMI API: KSh 500K/year**
- Complete data access
- Custom queries
- White-label options

---

## Implementation Priorities

### HIGH PRIORITY
1. Define B2B revenue model with university career centers as primary customer
2. Build "Skill Demand Report for [Degree]" MVP (2 weeks)
3. Reduce scraper scope to 3 sources (ATS, Gov, 1 board)
4. Implement evidence requirement for all extracted entities
5. Add 90% extraction quality gate

### MEDIUM PRIORITY
6. Create human-in-the-loop validation UI
7. Build role skill matrices for top 20 roles
8. Ship accuracy metrics display in UI
9. Create university pricing page
10. Pilot outreach to Strathmore, UoN, JKUAT

### LOW PRIORITY
11. Kill premium job seeker tier
12. Partner discussion with BrighterMonday

---

## Key Questions Answered

**Q: Who is your ONE paying customer?**
> University Career Centers (Strathmore, UoN, JKUAT, USIU, Aga Khan)

**Q: How will you get to 90%+ accuracy?**
> Evidence requirement + rule-based extraction + human-in-the-loop + narrow domain focus

**Q: What's your defense against BrighterMonday?**
> Don't compete. Different product (intelligence layer vs. job board), different customer (B2B vs. B2C)

**Q: What's the smallest version ONE customer would pay for TODAY?**
> Skill Demand Report for [Degree Program] - KSh 5,000 per report

---

## Revised Pitch

**Next Step** is the **labor market intelligence layer for Kenyan universities and institutions.**

We turn raw job postings into actionable skill demand data, helping universities answer: *"What do employers actually want from our graduates?"*

**Tagline:** *"We don't match candidates to jobs. We match curricula to reality."*

---

## Next Milestones

- **March 2026**: Ship first paid report to 3 pilot universities
- **June 2026**: Convert 1 university to annual subscription
- **December 2026**: 5 paying universities, KSh 1M+ ARR

---

## Lessons from The Crucible

1. **Be honest about weaknesses** - Admitting them upfront built credibility
2. **Pick ONE customer** - Trying to serve everyone serves no one
3. **Accuracy is non-negotiable** - 65% isn't "good enough for MVP"
4. **Features aren't products** - Aggregation is a feature, not a business
5. **Revenue model first** - Free product with no payer is a hobby
