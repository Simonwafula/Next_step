## Success Criteria

**Pilot is successful if:**
- ✅ 70%+ activation rate (35+ out of 50 students log in)
- ✅ 50%+ profile completion rate (25+ complete profiles)
- ✅ 30%+ application rate (15+ students send applications)
- ✅ 10+ positive testimonials
- ✅ 2+ students secure jobs via platform

**If we hit these metrics, we can pitch universities with:**
> "In our 30-day pilot with [X] students, 70% actively used the platform, 50% completed profiles, and 30% sent job applications. The platform demonstrably increases student career engagement."

---

## Troubleshooting

### Low Signup Rate
**Problem:** < 20 signups after 7 days
**Solution:**
- Add referral program (referrer gets priority access to new features)
- Partner with university career center for official endorsement
- Promote exclusivity ("Only 50 spots, VIP early access")

### Low Activation Rate
**Problem:** < 50% of signups log in
**Solution:**
- Send more aggressive reminders (Day 1, Day 3, Day 5)
- Call students directly (if < 10 signups)
- Add WhatsApp group for beta users (community engagement)

### Low Engagement Rate
**Problem:** Users log in but don't use platform
**Solution:**
- Gamification (leaderboard: "Top 10 users get special recognition + feature requests")
- Daily WhatsApp nudges with specific job recommendations
- 1-on-1 concierge onboarding (schedule Zoom calls)

### Job Quality Issues
**Problem:** Users complain "no relevant jobs"
**Solution:**
- Expand scraping sources immediately
- Manually curate 50 high-quality entry-level jobs
- Add international remote jobs (Upwork, Remote.co)
