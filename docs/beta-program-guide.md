4. **User Table:** Recent signups with status and activity

---

## Success Criteria

**Pilot is successful if:**
- ✅ 20%+ conversion rate (10+ out of 50 professionals convert to paid)
- ✅ 60%+ activation rate (30+ professionals log in and use features)
- ✅ KES 2,000-3,000 MRR after 30 days (10 paid x KES 200-300/month)
- ✅ 5+ testimonials highlighting ROI/value
- ✅ Average engagement score 60%+ (proves product-market fit)

**If we hit these metrics, we have a viable B2C business:**
> "20% conversion = KES 2K MRR per 50 signups. Scale to 1,000 users = KES 40K MRR. 10,000 users = KES 400K MRR (~$3K USD). Kenya has 2M+ working professionals - huge addressable market."

---

## Troubleshooting

### Low Signup Rate
**Problem:** < 20 signups after 7 days
**Solution:**
- Increase LinkedIn outreach (target 200+ messages)
- Post in 10+ professional WhatsApp groups
- Offer extended free trial (45 days instead of 30)
- Add referral bonus (refer a friend, get 1 month free)

### Low Activation Rate
**Problem:** < 50% of signups log in
**Solution:**
- Send more aggressive reminders (Day 1, Day 3, Day 5)
- Call students directly (if < 10 signups)
- Add WhatsApp group for beta users (community engagement)

### Low Engagement Rate
**Problem:** Users log in but don't use platform
**Solution:**
- Gamification (leaderboard: "Top 10 users get special recognition + feature requests")
- Daily WhatsApp nudges with specific job recommendations
- 1-on-1 concierge onboarding (schedule Zoom calls)

### Job Quality Issues
**Problem:** Users complain "no relevant jobs"
**Solution:**
- Expand scraping sources immediately
- Manually curate 50 high-quality entry-level jobs
- Add international remote jobs (Upwork, Remote.co)

---

## Scaling Plan (After Pilot Success)

### Growth Metrics to Track
1. **Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC):**
   - How much does it cost to acquire 1 paid user?
   - Target: < KES 500 per paid user
   - Channels: Organic (LinkedIn, Twitter), Paid (Facebook, Google Ads)

2. **Lifetime Value (LTV):**
   - Average subscription length: 12 months = KES 2,400-3,600
   - Target: LTV > 3x CAC (KES 1,500 CAC → KES 4,500+ LTV)

3. **Churn Rate:**
   - % of users who cancel after 1st month
   - Target: < 20% monthly churn

### Scaling Strategy
**Month 1-2 (Beta):** 50 users, 20% conversion = 10 paid = KES 2K MRR
**Month 3-4:** Open signups, 200 users, 15% conversion = 30 paid = KES 6K MRR
**Month 5-6:** Start ads, 500 users, 12% conversion = 60 paid = KES 12K MRR
**Month 7-12:** Scale ads, 2,000 users, 10% conversion = 200 paid = KES 40K MRR

**Burn KES 50K-100K on ads in months 7-12 to reach KES 40K MRR.**
